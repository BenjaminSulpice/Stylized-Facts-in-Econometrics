1 Returns are stationary
3 Returns are asymmetric: negative skewness
4 Returns have heavy tails: large positive excess kurtosis
5 Aggregational Gaussianity: lower frequencies (i.e. aggregated) returns tend to be Gaussian, even if the higher frequency returns (daily) are not.
6 Returns are not autocorrelated
7 Returns feature volatility clustering ⇔ long run range dependence of
squared returns
8 Leverage effect
